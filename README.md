# techno-berne
A "Berne Convention" for digital rights that anyone can contribute to.

## What we're trying to accomplish
We're hoping to make this an international treaty that countries can sign on to, like the [Berne Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention) for copyrights.

1. Establish international standards for freedom of speech and freedom from online harassment and censorship
2. Establish international standards for balancing intellectual property protection, fair use, and free culture (including open source software) on the Internet
3. Establish international standards for protecting digital privacy
4. Establish international standards for protecting net neutrality

## Contributing
There are multiple ways to contribute:

1. Adding a position paper to the [wiki](https://github.com/aidan-fitz/techno-berne/wiki). Anyone with a GitHub account can do this.
2. Submitting or replying to an issue - [view issues](https://github.com/aidan-fitz/techno-berne/issues)
3. Forking and submitting a pull request
4. If you'd like to contribute directly, send an email to Aidan Fitzgerald (acf67 AT cornell DOT edu) with the subject line "TECHNO-BERNE CONTRIBUTOR: " + your name.

The treaty will be composed of Markdown files. To build the pretty PDF version, we'll run it through Pandoc with a LaTeX template. We're open to other text formats that GitHub supports (see [github/markup](https://github.com/github/markup) for a full list), especially if they support cross-references between sections, which are common in legal documents.
